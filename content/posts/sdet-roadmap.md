# Overview
Learning is a continuous process and based on the requirements the learning topics also change time to time. But there are certain key concepts that help all the time. I have tried to jot down below the key skills required for a Software Developer in Test Engineer (focused on Java tooling) and corresponding training materials. 

**Disclaimer:** This is an opinionated list and does not claim to be 100% complete. And the key to get better at anything is practice :)
